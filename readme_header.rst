reFILE
======

List, rename and delete files using Python-style regex.

**THIS PROGRAM IS STILL IN THE ALPHA TESTING STAGE SO PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOU
KEEP REGULAR BACKUPS AND DO NOT USE IT ON ANY IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS OR FILES**


------------
Installation
------------

reFILE should be available on the PyPI repository so installing should be as
simple as::
    
    $ pip install reFILE

Alternatively you can clone the github repository and use setuptools, like so::
    
    $ git clone https://github.com/Sean1708/reFILE.git
    $ python setup.py install

reFILE uses the pathlib module which only has tentative support for Python 2.
For this reason, it is reccomended that you use Python 3 to download reFILE.
Having said this, however, reFILE should still work on Python 2 installations.
